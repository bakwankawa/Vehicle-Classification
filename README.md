# Vehicle-Classification
A task from campus to do classification using dataset Cifar10 with regulation.
- In this project im using CNN and sequential model from Tensorflow
- Without regulation (normalization + dropout) the accuracy of model was 68.6%
- After implement regulation (normalization + dropout) the accuracy was higher, 88.6%
